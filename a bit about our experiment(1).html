            <h3>Welcome to the TripTip website! Israel's attractions site<br /><br /></h3>
        <p  >
            
            Here is a series of web pages, with one or several questions on each page.<br /><br />
            The following questionnaire will express your preferences regarding different<br /><br />
            types of attractions (you will be required to rank on a moving scale),<br /><br />
            so that the system can perform an adjustment calculation. <br /><br />
            Once your preferences are loaded, the system will show you its recommendation.<br /><br />
            To complete the experiment you must answer the questions until you reach the end page.<br /><br />
            It is not possible to go back between pages. Therefore, move forward only when<br /><br />
            the answers you have provided are final for you.<br /><br />

            The experiment should be performed alone and independently.<br />
             You are asked not to pass on information about the content of the experiment to any other participant.<br />
